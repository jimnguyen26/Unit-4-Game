# Unit-4-Game

Hey, everyone! Here goes my jQuery Assignment. It's a CrystalsCollector game! It begins with a random number generated that you can see. Also each crystal has a hidden random value at the beginning of the game. Click on each crystal to add that to your score. Go over the random number and you lose, get it right and you win! good luck!

<!-- Could not figure out how to reset the score after a win or lose.  -->
